To run the preprocessing script:

Make sure your PC has ~16gb ram available, or this will NOT work.

Extract all .zip files into their respective directories -- this means there will be TWO files with 12 .grib files EACH --.

Make sure to replace the PATH in the script with the path to your own directories containing these files, and DO NOT rename any files. 

Enjoy.
