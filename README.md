To view a model's code and how it functions, please open the appropriate model's .ipynb file. 
There, a notebook will show all the previously executed code, including plots, results, print statements and terminal outputs.

In case the model does not show up properly, run the notebook as follows:
1. Select an appropriate python runtime.
2. Replace the absolute file path at the top of the relevant notebook with your own absolute file path. Make sure to replace all '\' with '/'.
3. Run the full notebook. Note that this will take some time, with some models taking longer than others. Please be patient and do not interrupt the runtime.

To run the GUI, simply run the Main.java file.

Thank you for reading.
