# Welcome to our project 2-2 submission. 

# In the "Python" directory, you can find all the notebooks and scripts we used to:
### 1) fetch the data from the CDSAPI ###
### 2) pre-process the data ### 
### 3) train our models ### 

###  If you want to check the code behind any of those topics, please find them in the "Python" directory.

# In the "NL_data" directory, you can find all the files we used for this project. You need to follow the following steps to get the files in .csv format:
1) locate the "data_set_1" and "data_set_2" directories
2) unzip the archives you find in these directories, and DO NOT rename any file, DO NOT move any file to another location
3) run the "data_preprocessor.py" script, and CHANGE THE "path1" and "path2" variables in this script to the "data_set_1" and "data_set_2" paths
4) let the script run, it takes a while (20 minutes)

# CHECKING OUR FORECASTS USING OUR GUI
### For our two most "interesting" models, namely the SARIMA and the LSTM, you can check forecasts up to 72 hours in the future using our GUI.
## In the "gui_forecast" directory, you will find the Java files you need to run our GUI. Please run the "GUI.java" file, and experiment with our forecasts.

Thank you for reading.
